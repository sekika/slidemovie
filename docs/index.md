**slidemovie** is a powerful Python tool designed to bridge the gap between simple text documentation and professional video presentations.

By combining the structural simplicity of **Markdown**, the design capabilities of **Microsoft PowerPoint**, and the power of **AI Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, `slidemovie` allows you to rapidly produce high-quality narration videos without the need for video editing software or recording equipment.

## How It Works

The process creates a synergy between automation and human design:

1.  **Structure & Script (Markdown)**: You define *what* to say and show using a simple text file.
2.  **Visual Design (PowerPoint)**: You use PowerPoint's AI "Designer" to make it look professional.
3.  **Production (slidemovie)**: The tool automatically generates voiceovers, converts slides to images, and stitches everything into a synchronized video.

## Key Features

*   **Markdown-Based**: Version control your video scripts just like code.
*   **AI Narration**: Utilizes Google Gemini or OpenAI to generate natural-sounding voiceovers.
*   **No Video Editing Required**: The timing of the video is automatically adjusted to match the length of the narration.
*   **Incremental Builds**: If you change a single slide's script, the tool only regenerates that specific part, saving time and API costs.

Please proceed to the **[Installation](./installation.html)** page to get started.
