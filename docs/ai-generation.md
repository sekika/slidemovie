# Generating Scripts with AI

Writing the Markdown script manually can be time-consuming. You can use Large Language Models (LLMs) like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or **Google Gemini** to generate the `slidemovie` compatible Markdown for you.

## The Prompt

Copy and paste the prompt below into your AI chat interface. Replace the `(Documentation follows)` section at the bottom with the text or documentation you want to turn into a video.

### Prompt Template

```text
Create a video introducing the Python program slidemovie. The goal is to explain the purpose of the program and how it is useful to someone who knows nothing about it. You can skip technical details, as the user can refer to the manual for those.

The objective is to generate a Markdown file based on the documentation that will be used to create slides and a "reading script" for AI narration.

Based on the "Markdown Creation Rules" and the "Documentation" below, please create a **Markdown file convertible to PowerPoint (pptx) using Pandoc**.

## Markdown Creation Rules

1.  **Write the reading script (for audio) only in the `notes` block.**

    *   **The `notes` block must be a "finished reading script"**: Do not include symbols or annotations; make it ready for a narrator to read aloud exactly as written.
    *   Do not write "spoken language" in the slide body.

2.  **1 Slide = 1 Topic Unit**

    *   Split the slides when the topic changes in the script.

3.  **Use only standard Pandoc Markdown syntax.**

    *   Do not use HTML tags.

## Markdown Structure Rules

*   Start each slide with `# Header`.
*   Do not use headers of level `##` or lower.
*   Construct the slide body using only:
    *   Headers
    *   Bullet points
*   **You must insert at least one empty line between the end of the slide body and `::: notes`.**
    *   Do not write `::: notes` immediately after bullet points, images, or paragraphs. If there is no empty line, the notes will be displayed as part of the slide body.

*   Write the reading script **strictly in the following format**:

::: notes
(Write the text to be read aloud for this slide, based on the transcript, in a format ready for speech.)
:::

*   Include all **supplementary information and spoken language not shown on the slide** in the notes.
*   The content of the slide body and notes **may overlap**.

## Output Format

*   **Output Markdown only.**
*   Do not write explanations, preambles, or comments.
*   Output the entire file as a single Markdown.

## Documentation
(PASTE YOUR TEXT OR DOCUMENTATION HERE)
```

## How to use the Output

1.  Copy the Markdown code block generated by the AI.
2.  Paste it into a text file (e.g., `ai_project.md`).
3.  Run `slidemovie ai_project -p` to generate the slides.
4.  Follow the standard workflow to edit the design and generate the video.

## Example Result

Here is an actual Markdown file generated by AI using the prompt above, and the resulting video.

# Introduction to slidemovie

::: notes
Welcome to the introduction of slidemovie. Today I will explain the purpose of this program and how it can revolutionize the way you create presentation videos.
:::

# The Challenge of Video Creation

-   Recording voiceovers is difficult
-   Video editing takes time
-   Synchronizing audio and slides is tedious
-   Updating content requires re-recording

::: notes
Creating professional presentation videos is often a struggle. You usually have to record your own voice, which can be intimidating and requires a quiet environment. Then comes the hours of video editing to manually synchronize your speech with the slides. Furthermore, if you need to change just one sentence later, you often have to start the whole process over.
:::

# What is slidemovie?

-   Automates video production
-   Combines Markdown, PowerPoint, and AI
-   No video editing software needed
-   No recording equipment required

::: notes
Slidemovie is the solution to these problems. It is a powerful tool that automates video production by combining the structural simplicity of Markdown text, the design capabilities of Microsoft PowerPoint, and the power of Artificial Intelligence. With this program, you do not need complex video editing software or expensive recording equipment.
:::

# Step 1: Write the Script

-   Use a simple text file (Markdown)
-   Define slide content
-   Write narration script

::: notes
The workflow is incredibly simple. First, you write your content in a standard text file using Markdown. In this single file, you define exactly what appears on the slide and write the script that the narrator will read aloud.
:::

# Step 2: Design the Slides

-   Automatically generate PowerPoint file
-   Use PowerPoint "Designer" feature
-   Apply professional layouts instantly

::: notes
Next, the program converts your text into a draft PowerPoint file. You can then open this file and use PowerPoint's built-in AI Designer to apply professional layouts and visuals instantly. This gives you full creative control over the look of your presentation without having to design from scratch.
:::

# Step 3: Generate the Video

-   Run a single command
-   AI generates natural voiceovers
-   Slides are converted to images
-   Audio and video are synchronized automatically

::: notes
Finally, you run a single command to build the video. The program uses advanced AI to generate natural-sounding voiceovers from your script. It then automatically stitches the audio and slide images together, handling all the timing and synchronization for you.
:::

# Key Benefits

-   Treat videos like code
-   Easy version control
-   Incremental updates
-   Save time and effort

::: notes
One of the biggest advantages is that you can treat your videos like code. If you need to update a slide, you simply edit the text file and rebuild. The program is smart enough to only regenerate the parts that changed, saving you massive amounts of time compared to traditional video editing.
